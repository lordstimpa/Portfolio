# Portfolio

## Overview

This portfolio was made with the React library.

Main goal by developing this webb app was by designing a minimalist website which was easy to use.

## Bugs / Fixes

Currently you are unable to send emails with the use of the form developed in this app.
The cause of this is from hosting the app through Netlify which leads to a bug that causes the form to never be sent.

No solution has been established since a new portfolio is on the works.
